Before:
frontend: 20.5 MB
backend: 167 MB

after:
frontend: 20.5 MB
backend: 994 MB

Frontend size stayed the same as it uses multi-stage dockerfile. It seems like
good way to minimize production image size for frontend projects. For
development it's probably good to have node in the container so that
development tools can be used.

Previous backend used node-alpine image, and the new image uses default
node:10. Size is a lot larger as the default node image has most common
packages pre-installed. Additionally the default image is based off debian
which makes the resulting images somewhat larger.
